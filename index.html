										<h3>Spark for IT</h3>
										<p>Growing during rapid change in technological era, the reason for my interest in technology become crystal clear.
                                         Since I can remember, I have been obsessed with the complication of technological innovations that were going through. My interest in IT was sparked when my father bought Computer for me.
                                         I was fascinated by the parts inside CPU, motherboard and the other parts.
                                         I sometime took it apart and understand their importance in CPU and then try to assemble, sometimes it does sometime not.
										</br> That gave me spark and inspired me to look deeper into the field.</p>

                                    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50390886?type=standout#searchRequestToken=56eacbaa-514d-4474-96c4-a85fc7b9215e">
									<strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong></a>.</p>

								<ul class="statistics">

                                         <span class="icon solid fa-code-branch"></span>
										<strong>Skills</strong> Required: Java 8, JavaScript libraries and web development in HTML5, CSS3 </br> Current: Java and Sql</br>
									</li>

									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-laptop"></span>
										<strong>Qualification</strong> Required: •	Strong expertise across data structures and algorithms</br>•	Team player
                                        </br>•	A strong desire to learn and grow skillset </br> Current: None </br>

										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Experience</strong> Required: 2+ year's experience</br> Current: None </br>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p > Currently don’t have a specific plan to approach those skills, qualification and experience, but have a rough idea about it.
                                 While studying Bachelor of IT course most of the skills will be covered and some qualification helped by RMIT Credential courses.
                                  And for experience, I thought of doing internships during annual break of year 2 and year 3 and try to get intermediate level job where I can learn more for my Ideal job or alike.</p>
